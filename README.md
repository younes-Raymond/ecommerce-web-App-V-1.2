# Ecommerce Webapp
A web application that helps ecommerce companies generate customers by specifying location and drawing it using leaflet.js. Customers can take a picture or upload it, and provide their phone number, full name, and send this information to the delivery guy. The application also sends an email to the customer to confirm the order. The information is saved in a database and can be retrieved by the delivery guy using a canvas that includes a leaflet.js map, showing the location, picture, and phone number.
